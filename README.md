#I'm a Movie Database!

Thanks for using IamDB! I'm a Movie Database, and I contain more cinema-related information than you can shake an Oscar at.
I have the following features:
- CRUD repository of over 10,000 movies, pulled and sorted from a .csv file
- search function
- "list all" function
- add new movies
- fun fact--I was built in a day!
